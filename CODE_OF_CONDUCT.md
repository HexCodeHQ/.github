# ðŸ“• Code of Conduct

This community is a community of developers, learners, and enthusiasts who share a passion for coding and technology and all kinds of creative works. We welcome everyone who wants to join us and contribute to our projects, discussions, and events. However, we also expect all members to follow some basic rules of conduct to ensure a respectful, inclusive, and safe environment for everyone. 

## Github Guidelines and Terms of Use

As a Github-based community, we adhere to the Github Community Guidelines and the Github Terms of Service. These documents cover the general principles and policies that apply to all Github users and communities, such as:

- Respect each other
- Be welcoming and inclusive
- Be clear and constructive
- Report and block abuse
- Follow the law
- Respect privacy and confidentiality
- Respect intellectual property rights

Please read and follow these guidelines and terms of use carefully. Any violation of them may result in disciplinary action, such as warning, suspension, or removal from the community.

## Additional Rules of Conduct

While Github's [community guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines) and [code of conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct) cover more extreme cases of bad behaviour, there is still plenty of other behaviour that we want to consider regulating on our community. In addition to the rules and guidelines set forth by Github, we prohibit the following behaviours:

- **Trolling**: Trolling refers to the act of disrupting the chat, making a nuisance out of yourself, deliberately making others uncomfortable, or otherwise attempting to start trouble. Keep all discussions civil and in the right channels.
- **NSFW Material**: No NSFW content or conversations around illegal activities or controversial materials. This includes topics such as politics, religion, acts of violence, rape, suicide/self-harm, school shootings, and other serious topics; as well as inappropriate language and hates speech including racial slurs or derivatives thereof, sexist statements, and other similar types of behaviour.
- **Elitism**: Everyone should refrain from insulting or belittling others and others' taste based on their taste and opinion. Keep all discussions civil.
- **Spam**: Don't ping users unnecessarily. This applies to admins, moderators, public figures, HexCode employees and community members.
- **Incitement**: Encouraging the breaking of rules, inciting others to be blatantly rude and offensive, or otherwise promoting and/or encouraging conflicts between other members.
- **Disrespecting community Staff**: You will face consequences unless you listen to and respect the volunteers that keep this community running.

## Harassment and Reporting

Community moderators are here to help! If you or someone else is being harassed, or if you notice a user has broken our rules, please notify a community admin as soon as possible. You can also use the report feature on Github to flag any inappropriate content or behaviour. We will investigate the issue and take appropriate action.

## Enforcement

We reserve the right to enforce these rules of conduct at our discretion. Depending on the severity and frequency of the violation, we may take any of the following actions:

- Warn the user
- Mute the user
- Kick the user
- Ban the user
- Report the user to Github

We will also keep a record of any incidents and actions taken for future reference.
